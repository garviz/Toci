  abstract = {The MUMmer sequence alignment package is a suite of computer programs designed to detect regions of homology in long biological sequences. Version 2.1 makes several improvements to the package, including: increased speed and reduced memory requirements; the ability to handle both protein and DNA sequences; the ability to handle multiple sequence fragments; and new algorithms for clustering together basic matches. The system is particularly efficient at comparing highly similar sequences, such as alternative versions of fragment assemblies or closely related strains of the same bacterium.},

  abstract = {Genomic read alignment involves mapping (exactly or approximately) short reads from a particular individual onto a pre-sequenced reference genome of the same species. Because all individuals of the same species share the majority of their genomes, short reads alignment provides an alternative and much more efficient way to sequence the genome of a particular individual than does direct sequencing. Among many strategies proposed for this alignment process, indexing the reference genome and short read searching over the index is a dominant technique. Our goal is to design a space-efficient indexing structure with fast searching capability to catch the massive short reads produced by the next generation high-throughput DNA sequencing technology.},

abstract = {SUMMARY: We have developed essaMEM, a tool for finding maximal exact matches that can be used in genome comparison and read mapping. essaMEM enhances an existing sparse suffix array implementation with a sparse child array. Tests indicate that the enhanced algorithm for finding maximal exact matches is much faster, while maintaining the same memory footprint. In this way, sparse suffix arrays remain competitive with the more complex compressed suffix arrays.

@article{Khan2009,
abstract = {Motivation: High-throughput sequencing technologies place ever increasing demands on existing algorithms for sequence analysis. Algorithms for computing maximal exact matches (MEMs) between sequences appear in two contexts where high-throughput sequencing will vastly increase the volume of sequence data: (i) seeding alignments of high-throughput reads for genome assembly and (ii) designating anchor points for genomeâ€“genome comparisons.Results: We introduce a new algorithm for finding MEMs. The algorithm leverages a sparse suffix array (SA), a text index that stores every K-th position of the text. In contrast to a full text index that stores every position of the text, a sparse SA occupies much less memory. Even though we use a sparse index, the output of our algorithm is the same as a full text index algorithm as long as the space between the indexed suffixes is not greater than a minimum length of a MEM. By relying on partial matches and additional text scanning between indexed positions, the algorithm trades memory for extra computation. The reduced memory usage makes it possible to determine MEMs between significantly longer sequences.Availability: Source code for the algorithm is available under a BSD open source license at http://compbio.cs.princeton.edu/mems. The implementation can serve as a drop-in replacement for the MEMs algorithm in MUMmer 3.Contact: zkhan@cs.princeton.edu;mona@cs.princeton.eduSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online. },

abstract = {Traditionally an area of study in computer science, string algorithms have, in recent years, become an increasingly important part of biology, particularly genetics. This volume is a comprehensive look at computer algorithms for string processing. In addition to pure computer science, Gusfield adds extensive discussions on biological problems that are cast as string problems and on methods developed to solve them. This text emphasizes the fundamental ideas and techniques central to today's applications. New approaches to this complex material simplify methods that up to now have been for the specialist alone. With over 400 exercises to reinforce the material and develop additional topics, the book is suitable as a text for graduate or advanced undergraduate students in computer science, computational biology, or bio-informatics.},

@article{Kim2010,
abstract = {In-memory tree structured index search is a fundamental database operation. Modern processors provide tremendous computing power by integrating multiple cores, each with wide vector units. There has been much work to exploit modern processor architectures for database primitives like scan, sort, join and aggregation. However, unlike other primitives, tree search presents significant challenges due to irregular and unpredictable data accesses in tree traversal. In this paper, we present FAST, an extremely fast architecture sensitive layout of the index tree. FAST is a binary tree logically organized to optimize for architecture features like page size, cache line size, and SIMD width of the underlying hardware. FAST eliminates impact of memory latency, and exploits thread-level and datalevel parallelism on both CPUs and GPUs to achieve 50 million (CPU) and 85 million (GPU) queries per second, 5X (CPU) and 1.7X (GPU) faster than the best previously reported performance on the same architectures. FAST supports efficient bulk updates by rebuilding index trees in less than 0.1 seconds for datasets as large as 64Mkeys and naturally integrates compression techniques, overcoming the memory bandwidth bottleneck and achieving a 6X performance improvement over uncompressed index search for large keys on CPUs.},
