%% The '3p' and 'times' class options of elsarticle are used for Elsevier CRC
\documentclass[3p,times]{elsarticle}

%% The `ecrc' package must be called to make the CRC functionality available
\usepackage{ecrc}

%% The ecrc package defines commands needed for running heads and logos.
%% For running heads, you can set the journal name, the volume, the starting page and the authors

%% set the volume if you know. Otherwise `00'
\volume{00}

%% set the starting page if not 1
\firstpage{1}

%% Give the name of the journal
\journalname{Procedia Computer Science}

%% Give the author list to appear in the running head
%% Example \runauth{C.V. Radhakrishnan et al.}
\runauth{}

%% The choice of journal logo is determined by the \jid and \jnltitlelogo commands.
%% A user-supplied logo with the name <\jid>logo.pdf will be inserted if present.
%% e.g. if \jid{yspmi} the system will look for a file yspmilogo.pdf
%% Otherwise the content of \jnltitlelogo will be set between horizontal lines as a default logo

%% Give the abbreviation of the Journal.
\jid{procs}

%% Give a short journal name for the dummy logo (if needed)
\jnltitlelogo{Procedia Computer Science}

%% Hereafter the template follows `elsarticle'.
%% For more details see the existing template files elsarticle-template-harv.tex and elsarticle-template-num.tex.

%% Elsevier CRC generally uses a numbered reference style
%% For this, the conventions of elsarticle-template-num.tex should be followed (included below)
%% If using BibTeX, use the style file elsarticle-num.bst

%% End of ecrc-specific commands
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%% The amssymb package provides various useful mathematical symbols
\usepackage{amssymb}
%% The amsthm package provides extended theorem environments
%% \usepackage{amsthm}

%% The lineno packages adds line numbers. Start line numbering with
%% \begin{linenumbers}, end it with \end{linenumbers}. Or switch it on
%% for the whole article with \linenumbers after \end{frontmatter}.
%% \usepackage{lineno}

%% natbib.sty is loaded by default. However, natbib options can be
%% provided with \biboptions{...} command. Following options are
%% valid:

%%   round  -  round parentheses are used (default)
%%   square -  square brackets are used   [option]
%%   curly  -  curly braces are used      {option}
%%   angle  -  angle brackets are used    <option>
%%   semicolon  -  multiple citations separated by semi-colon
%%   colon  - same as semicolon, an earlier confusion
%%   comma  -  separated by comma
%%   numbers-  selects numerical citations
%%   super  -  numerical citations as superscripts
%%   sort   -  sorts multiple citations according to order in ref. list
%%   sort&compress   -  like sort, but also compresses numerical citations
%%   compress - compresses without sorting
%%
%% \biboptions{comma,round}

\begin{abstract}
  Maximal Unique Matches are common substrings that are found between a reference and a query sequence. They are exact, unique and maximal; that is, they cannot be extended in left or right direction without incurring a mismatch. The computation of MUMs in large sequences is a heavy and repetitive task because the genomes are closely related, so there is a fair chance of parallelize and execute this search in multicore architectures. This research resembles a first novel approach to find MUMs in genomic sequences in parallel way. The reference genome is indexed by using a suffix tree in main memory and then the parallelized algorithm finds the MUMs against a query genome which is readed by several threads. This approach is based on MUMmer, a genome alignment tool, which is able to find Maximal Unique Matches (MUMs).

\section{Problem}
\label{}
The problem of searching maximal unique matching for a minimum lengthbetween a reference
string and a query string has been
identified in several applications, one of them is MUMmer. Altough
MUMmer's algorithm can perform searches of maximal unique matches (MUMs)
the use of resources are not well used:
\begin{itemize}
  \item High use of main memory to store the reference string.
  \item A null use of multicore architectures.
\end{itemize}
If the length of reference and query are very huge, the amount of operations to perform
in the search of MUMs increases, see table \ref{tbl:operations}.

%% References

%% Following citation commands can be used in the body text:
%% Usage of \cite is as follows:
%%   \cite{key}         ==>>  [#]
%%   \cite[chap. 2]{key} ==>> [#, chap. 2]
%%

%% References with BibTeX database:
\section*{References}
\bibliographystyle{elsarticle-num}
\bibliography{<your-bib-database>}

%% Authors are advised to use a BibTeX database file for their reference list.
%% The provided style file elsarticle-num.bst formats references in the required Procedia style

%% For references without a BibTeX database:

% \begin{thebibliography}{00}

%% \bibitem must have the following form:
%%   \bibitem{key}...
%%

% \bibitem{}

% \end{thebibliography}
