Version 2.1 makes several improvements to the package, including: increased speed and reduced memory requirements; the ability to handle both protein and DNA sequences; the ability to handle multiple sequence fragments; and new algorithms for clustering together basic matches. The system is particularly efficient at comparing highly similar sequences, such as alternative versions of fragment assemblies or closely related strains of the same bacterium.},

Tests indicate that the enhanced algorithm for finding maximal exact matches is much faster, while maintaining the same memory footprint. In this way, sparse suffix arrays remain competitive with the more complex compressed suffix arrays.

@article{Khan2009,
abstract = {Motivation: High-throughput sequencing technologies place ever increasing demands on existing algorithms for sequence analysis. Algorithms for computing maximal exact matches (MEMs) between sequences appear in two contexts where high-throughput sequencing will vastly increase the volume of sequence data: (i) seeding alignments of high-throughput reads for genome assembly and (ii) designating anchor points for genome–genome comparisons.Results: We introduce a new algorithm for finding MEMs. The algorithm leverages a sparse suffix array (SA), a text index that stores every K-th position of the text. In contrast to a full text index that stores every position of the text, a sparse SA occupies much less memory. Even though we use a sparse index, the output of our algorithm is the same as a full text index algorithm as long as the space between the indexed suffixes is not greater than a minimum length of a MEM. By relying on partial matches and additional text scanning between indexed positions, the algorithm trades memory for extra computation. The reduced memory usage makes it possible to determine MEMs between significantly longer sequences.Availability: Source code for the algorithm is available under a BSD open source license at http://compbio.cs.princeton.edu/mems. The implementation can serve as a drop-in replacement for the MEMs algorithm in MUMmer 3.Contact: zkhan@cs.princeton.edu;mona@cs.princeton.eduSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online. },

abstract = {Traditionally an area of study in computer science, string algorithms have, in recent years, become an increasingly important part of biology, particularly genetics. This volume is a comprehensive look at computer algorithms for string processing. In addition to pure computer science, Gusfield adds extensive discussions on biological problems that are cast as string problems and on methods developed to solve them. This text emphasizes the fundamental ideas and techniques central to today's applications. New approaches to this complex material simplify methods that up to now have been for the specialist alone. With over 400 exercises to reinforce the material and develop additional topics, the book is suitable as a text for graduate or advanced undergraduate students in computer science, computational biology, or bio-informatics.},
